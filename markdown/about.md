## About this Site
***
This site was created to offer some guides and tips that you may (hopefully) find useful coming to UIdaho. It is coded, maintained and hosted by Tyler (your
RA). If you would like to use this for a personal website, I have good news...its on [Github and it is MIT licensed](https://github.com/tylerhand/cals-floor)!

#### For Contributors:
This site is written in Markdown, a markup language used commonly with python docs \(please note that this is standard markdown and not Github flavored Markdown.


Don't know markdown? It is a simple markup language used by developers, mostly for writing documentation. I have a cheat sheet on my website here \(which is
also a Flask markdown renderer, only a little fancier\) [It can be found here.](https://www.tylerhand.com/tutorials/markdown/reference)

#### For Developers:
This site is a simple Python app that renders markdown into an HTML template. It is running on the Flask microframework and is hosted on Pythonanywhere.
Nothing special really. If you would like to contribute, [submit a pull request](https://github.com/tylerhand)!<br>

###### For Learning Python \(if you are looking at tutorials, make sure you are learning Python 3 instead of Python 2. Python 2 will reach the end of its life next year. \(All of these are Python 3 tutorials.\)
