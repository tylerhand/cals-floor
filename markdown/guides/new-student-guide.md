### New Student Guide: Welcome to the University of Idaho!
***
<small>Here are some things to help get you ready for the first day of classes. I am also happy to answer any questions \(you can email me under the "more" tab.\)</small>

#### Here are some things you should do before classes begin...

1. **If you have not already, set up your vandal accounts.** This includes your vandal email \(e.g. name0000@vandals.uidaho.edu\) and Vandalweb. It is extremely
important that these are set up, as all important University communications are sent through this email. If you have yet to do this, set it up after reading this,
as messages are probably already waiting for you. For more information, see this [ITS Help Page.](https://support.uidaho.edu/TDClient/KB/ArticleDet?ID=196)
2. **Start thinking about textbooks.** You can view your textbooks on the [Vandal Store Website.](https://www.vandalstore.com/vandal/SiteText.aspx?id=34127)
Create an account and get your textbook list. Here are some tips that I have learned about textbooks over time...\(1\)
3. **Find your classes.** Before classes begin, go and find your classes. You can find your class schedule with room assignments in your
[Vandalweb Account.](https://vandalweb.uidaho.edu) That way, you won't be lost on your first day of classes. You may have classes back to back with 10 minutes
between them...Don't worry, this is plenty of time \(but is still all the more reason to find your classes before they start\). Also, in my experience, classes
rarely run over.
4. **Have fun, make some friends.** You have some time before classes begin \(they will be starting on Wednesday\), so go have some fun!!! Get to know your
roomate, explore campus and Moscow and go to some of the fun events happening in housing and around campus!
