### CALS Floor Mailing Lists
***
There are two mailing lists for CALS Floor...<br><br>

<strong>important@calsfloor.info:</strong> This list is for important emails and I will try to keep these to an abolute minimum. Due to the importance of
these messages, you cannot unsubscribe from these. I (Tyler your RA) and housing administration can post to this list, but it will be mostly me.<br><br>

<strong>general-information@calsfloor.info:</strong> This list is for general information about clubs, things to do, opportunities/scholarships and more.
This list can be posted to by the admin (me) and moderators which include CALS Staff. If you are a member of a club (or just have something to share),
you can post to this list be sending an email to a moderator. You can unsubscribe from this list by sending <a href="mailto:ra@calsfloor.info">me an email</a> (no hard feelings).
